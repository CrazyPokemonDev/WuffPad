Hooray friends!\nIf you attack the drunk, you yourself will become drunk, and will be unable to do the next attack as you sleep off your hangover! (Usually, this means you can't attack the following night, but if the Wolf Cub was killed and the Drunk was your first choice, you won't be able to kill the second player, and you will still be able to attack the following night.) </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutHarlot">
    <value>As the harlot (you slut...) you will be given the chance to 'visit' another player each night. If they are not the wolf, you will be told so (because you live!). If you visit a wolf, you will be killed. If you visit the player the wolves have chosen to kill, you will be killed as well. However - If you are visiting a player, and the wolves choose to kill you, you will survive (you weren't home)</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutDrunk">
    <value>You drunken bastard! As the drunk, you are still just a villager. BUT! If the wolves kill you, they will become disabled for the next kill, as they are drunk off your insanely high BAC.</value>

  <string key="AboutGA">
    <value>You are the Guardian Angel! Each night, you may choose a player to watch over. Be careful however - if you choose to watch over a wolf, there is a 50% chance you will be killed.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutDetective">

  <string key="AboutGunner">
    <value>A bit trigger happy are we? As the gunner, you are given 2 silver bullets at the beginning of the game. Each day, you will have the chance to shoot another player. Once you do, everyone will know you are the gunner! Be careful though, you only have 2 bullets!</value>

  <string key="AboutTanner">

  <string key="AboutFool">
    <value>he fool is told they are the seer.... when they choose to see someone's role at night, they are told a random role.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCult">
    <value>As a cultist, it is your goal to convert all other players (except wolves) to your cult. If at the end of the game, all living players are cultist - the cult wins</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCH">
    <value>Your job is to hunt the Cult. If the cult attacks you, their newest member will die. Each night you may pick a player to 'hunt' - if they are a cultist, they will die.</value>

  <string key="AboutMason">
    <value>A mason's job is simple - they automatically know who the other masons are. Otherwise, they are a simple villager.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutDG">
    <value>
      Your ancestors had the ability to metamorph into others... while you don't have their full abilities, you can pick a player at the start of the game. If that player dies, you will become what they were.
      Note: If the player was converted to cult, you will take on their original role. All other normal rules apply: If they were Wild Child and their role model died, you will become a wolf. Otherwise, you will inherit their role model.
      The cult cannot convert the Doppelgänger (but can after the doppelganger switches roles). Also - the Doppelgänger can NOT win unless they have transformed. If at the end of the game, the Doppelgänger is still the same, they lose (exception: lover)
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutCupid">
    <value>
      Love is in the air. As Cupid, you will choose two players at the start of the game. These two players will become madly in love! If one of them dies, the other will die of sorrow :(
      Note: Lovers will know who each other are, but not be told their roles. If the lovers are the last two alive, they win, regardless of teams. If the lovers are on different teams (villager + wolf), and one team wins (wolf), the lover (villager) wins as well. TL;DR if at least one of the lovers was on the winning team, they both win together.
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutHunter">
    <value>
      A trigger happy, vindictive player. As the hunter, you try to keep to yourself. However, when others come to visit you, they may find themselves dead, as your paranoia takes hold and you shoot. If the wolves attack you, you have a chance to take one of them with you. Otherwise, if you die, you will get a chance to shoot someone as you die.
      Note: For wolf attacks, the chance starts at 30%. If there is one wolf, the hunter has a 30% chance to kill the wolf (and survive). For each additional wolf, add 20% (2 wolves = 50%, 3 = 70%, etc). However - if there are multiple wolves, while you may kill one of them, you will still be outnumbered and killed.
      If the cult tries to convert you, they have a 50% chance to fail. If they fail, you have a 50% chance to kill one of them!
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutSK">
    <value>That asylum was silly anyways. What a joke. You are free now however, back to business as usual - killing! The serial killer is a lone player, on their own team. They can win only if they are the last player alive (exception: lovers). As the serial killer, you can kill ANYONE - wolves, hunters, gunners, guardian angels, whatever. If the wolves try to attack you, you will kill one of them (random), and live.</value>

  </string>
  <string key="BittenTurned">
    <value>As night falls, you feel a strange tingling, and your body aches as it begins to transform.... You are now a werewolf!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutMayor">
    <value>As mayor, you are a lowly villager, until you reveal yourself. Then you are given twice the vote count for lynching (meaning that your vote is twice as powerful as everyone else's). Use that power wisely to help the Village Team.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutPrince">
    <value>The prince is a key role in the Village Team's strategy. Once the prince gets lynched, their role as Prince is revealed, and they survive. However, this can only happen once: if the village insists on lynching them, they will die.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutSorcerer">
    <value>Do you remember the good old seer? Well now, it has its Wolf Team counterpart. The sorcerer is the Wuff's Seer. They can only see if someone is Wolf or Seer, and they win with the Wolves.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutClumsy">
    <value>You are the Clumsy Guy. Maybe you should not have had so much alcohol for breakfast. You can't see a damn thing. Can you even vote for the person you want to? (You have a 50% chance to vote for someone random.)</value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutBlacksmith">
    <value>You are the BlackSmith. Through the years, no blades nor swords gave you as much satisfaction as the Silver Blades the elves ordered.\nYou might have some silverdust left. Who knows ? It might *prevent Wolves from eating tonight* 🤔
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutAlphaWolf">
    <value>You are the Alpha Wolf, the origin of the curse, the bane of banes. Every night, there's 20% chance that you will bite your pack's meal, and they will join your ranks instead of dying!
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="AboutWolfCub">
    <value>What a cuuuute little wuff. _tickles tickles_ -cough cough- As i was saying, you are the Wolf Cub and you _drops the mic_ -I just can't resist that. I think if anyone killed you, i'd give the wuffs two victims. You're too cute to die. I wouldn't be able to tickle you anymore-</value>

  <string key="CultConvertWolf">
    <value>The cult sends {0} to try to convert {1}, but instead {0}'s Head comes flying out of the Window... Wonder why they thought it was inedible! {0} is dead...</value>
  </string>
  <string key="HarlotFuckedKilledPublic">
    <value>{0} slips into {1}'s house, ready for a night of passion, only to find a mysterious stranger surgically removing {1}'s innards! The serial killer decides to satisfy {0} before adding a slutty heart to their collection!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="ApprenticeSeerEaten">
    <value>The villagers awake to find {0} hunched over a second-hand Ouija board while practising fortune-telling, with head missing. The Apprentice Seer is dead.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="BlacksmithKilled">
    <value>Seems like {0}, the resident blacksmith, must have been extremely unlucky. Five knives, fresh from {0}'s armory, were found plunged into his hands, feet and head, and pinned to the craftsman's table last night. Maybe the serial killer was hoping to expand his weapon collection alongside his organ one...</value>
  </string>
  <string key="CultistKilled">
    <value>{0} was found stabbed to death with a candlestick by their altar. The serial killer has struck again, regardless of race, language or religion! {0} was a Cultist.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="CupidKilled">
    <value>The next morning, the villagers were heartbroken to find {0} a.k.a. Cupid split from head to toe. Strangely the heart was missing...</value>
  </string>
  <string key="DrunkKilled">
    <value>The villagers had hoped to meet {0} to compliment his Martell, but all they found in {0}'s home was a broken knife and liver. All those years of drinking led to a liver so hard that even the Serial Killer probably does not fancy it...</value>
  </string>
  <string key="GuardianAngelKilled">
    <value>{0} would normally have managed to fight off the serial killer, but it was an irony that the Guardian Angel's halo has extinguished. {0} is dead.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="GunnerKilled">
    <value>Looks like {0} was caught napping last night! A gunshot was heard last night, but all there was was the remains of a gunner, with a bullet hole to the head and a stab to the torso. Clearly the serial killer has won.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="MayorKilled">
    <value>Assassination! {0} the mayor was found pinned with a knife on the table while working overnight at the mayor office! Clearly it's the serial killer exacting revenge for the asylum robbing him of years of his life!</value>
  </string>
  <string key="PrinceKilled">
    <value>Bells ring across the village before the sunrise, as armed guards flood the streets investigating the disappearance of Prince {0}. No clues were discovered, but it is suspected that there is a Serial Killer on the loose...</value>
    <value>{0}'s guards were caught napping last night. The royal remains of {0} were found, hung in various parts of the palace, having fallen prey to the knife. No amount of princely blood would deter a serial killer's blade.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="SeerKilled">
    <value>The villagers wake up to a rotting corpse of {0}, split from head to toe, stabs all over. Strangely the brain was carefully extricated, as if it was a premonition that the village has lost their top brains. {0} was the Seer.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="SorcererEaten">
    <value>The sound of mournful howls can be heard across the village. A mistake has been made. The wolves have killed one of their own. The Sorcerer {0} is dead.</value>
    <value>Cries of "I'm your ally!" were heard last night. All the villagers found next morning were an exhumed body and smashed mystical ball, belonging to {0}, the sorcerer. Hunger trumps comradeship...</value>
  </string>
  <string key="WildChildEaten">
    <value>NOMNOMNOMNOM! The wolves were heard last night, eating up a tender Wild Child, {0}, leaving behind only a reduced-size skeleton! The village wondered if the wolves felt any guilt tearing apart the defenceless child.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="SerialKillerKilledCH">
    <value>The villagers wake up in the morning, only to find the severed body parts of {0}, the Cultist Hunter, in a cart placed in full view outside the town hall. Lesson learnt: don't visit the serial killer!</value>
    <value>The body of {0}, the Cultist Hunter, was found in the middle of town, albeit cut precisely into a hundred pieces. Checking if the Serial Killer was a cultist does not seem to be a good idea...</value>
  </string>
  <string key="CultConvertWolfPublic">
    <value>While it seemed that the wolves decided to stay good for once, punishing {0}, a cultist that decided to court trouble with the wolves, proved too difficult to resist. {0}'s head was converted to a fine supper, delivered to the wolves' doorsteps!</value>
    <value>The cult ran into unexpected trouble last night. Their newest member had the misfortune of visiting a wolf on the night the wolves decided to stay home, and the wolf found {0} quite delicious. Unfortunately for {0}, wolves have no interest in joining the new religious movement.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="CultConvertKillerPublic">
    <value>The cult thought they would have a new member in their ranks, but they were wrong! {0}, a cultist, was minced to pieces and placed at the town square in the morning! Strangely their "holy" book was found stabbed with a knife, as if a statement to show whose religion was triumphant.</value>
    <value>Last night, the cult tried to convert the one person in the village crazier than they are. Their newest member tried to convert the Serial Killer, and the Serial Killer made a new piece of art in the town square of {0}'s internal organs.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="GAGuardedKiller">
    <value>It was supposed to be a night where {0} would save the village from the killers, but {0}'s halo was extinguished and wings sliced by the serial killer! Left was a note, "I could protect myself better than you can."</value>
  </string>
  <string key="GAGuardedWolf">
    <value>{0} tried to guard a wolf last night. The town woke up to find only the wings of {0} hung on the church cross. Clearly the wolves had an extra meal god-sent, free-of-charge, to their homes.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="HunterKillsWolfEnd">
    <value>Knowing only {0} was left, {1} tries to eat {0} up, but {0}'s military training and paranoia proves too much to handle! All there is left is a carcass with two shots to the torso and the last man standing: the victorious hunter for the village!
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="WolfKillsHunterEnd">
    <value>Knowing only {0} was left, {1} chose a time where {0}'s guard was at their lowest. Eliminating the final villager proved to be effortless for {1}, for all there remains is a mutiliated body of {0}, the hunter, adorned with parallel slashes to the face.</value>
  </string>
  <string key="CHKillsCultistEnd">
    <value>{1} and {0} walk out in daylight. Seeing a shimmering cross worn around {0}'s neck, the righteous {1} draws their sword for the final time, putting an end to the twisted learnings of the cult that have contaminated the village.</value>
